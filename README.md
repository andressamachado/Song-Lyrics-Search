# Song Lyrics Search Application for Android
by **Andressa Machado**


## Description
Song Lyrics Search is an application developed in order to learn more about Android development. Althoug the general idea of 
the application is very simple, a great number of mobile development features was implemented. 

The application's name already gave us the idea for what it was developed for. User can type in an artist or group's name, followed 
by the title of one of their songs and the API will retrieve the lyric.

`When user searches for a song, it shows the lyric retrieved from the API and save it to the database. Every song searched by the user
is displayed in a ListView so the user can select a previously searched song and have access to the lyric quickly.`
